# Hangman game

A simple hangman game written in C

I wrote this game in the same time I wrote another game [[It's on Github too]](https://github.com/gabrielfelipeassuncaodesouza/pacman)
So the real age of this game is not the age of the repository, that's because I programmed this game when I was starting to learn about programming and I didn't know anything about git and things like that

Thanks for visiting :smile:
